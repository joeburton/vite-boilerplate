After this project was completed I joined the statements team implementing new features and improving the Micro Frontends code base.</p><p>Once becoming permanent my day-to-day tasks were focused on maintaining the trading platform. This involved adding new UI features, improving and refactoring the existing code base whilst pairing with team members working in a TDD approach.</p><p>Most of the React codebase was based on hooks and written in TypeScript. We used NodeJS to interact with the services and GraphQL to manage the data layer. I was also involved in the development of a custom component library used across multiple Micro Frontends. During this time I worked closely with Product, BA’s and UX to help define requirements and stories.</p><p>For the last eight months at WorldFirst, I worked as a Tech Lead, leading a team of Front-end Developers. I was responsible for managing the team's goals and deliverables. During this period WorldFirst and Ant Group embarked on a major replatforming project for the main trading platform. This involved daily collaboration with our Chinese counterparts in Ant Group. On a day-to-day basis my team and I worked with back-end developers and other front-end development teams along with Product, UX, Marketing and other business stakeholders across the UK and APAC to help deliver a new multi-regional front-end for the trading platform.</p>",
